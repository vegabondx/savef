        Usage:\\
          %savef [options]

        Options:

            -s: SET new file to write , otherwise would write to temp.py

            -f: force create new file ( overwrite original to be used with -s )

            -r: use 'raw' input.  By default, the 'processed' history is used,
            so that magics are loaded in their transformed version to valid
            Python.  If this option is given, the raw input as typed as the
            command line is used instead.

        It works in modes either you can start a file or write commands,not both simultaneously
        This function serves as an extension to %save magic function.It writes to
        a file line by line instead of block for rapid development.
        Possible Enhancements (1) merge with save
